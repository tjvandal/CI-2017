# Uncertainty Quantification for Statistical Downscaling using Bayesian Deep Learning

The jupyter notebook provided in this repository presents three methods of bayesian deep learning applied to statistical downscaling.  All figures in our paper <http://www1.coe.neu.edu/~tvandal/files/vandalci2017.pdf> can be generated by this notebook.
